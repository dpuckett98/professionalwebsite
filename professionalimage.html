		<p style="text-align:left;">I am interested in learning about and growing the field in several areas of technology: neural networks, parallel processing, computer architecture, and cybersecurity. In the Spring of 2019, I <a target="_blank" href="DLI C-FX-01 Certificate _ Deep Learning Institute.html">completed</a> a deep learning course put on by NVIDIA which peaked my interest in neural networks. Over the next couple weeks, I designed and implemented my own neural network. Interestingly enough, this project also introduced me to parallel processing, which I have fallen in love with. In one of my classes that semester, I had the opportunity to run my neural network code on both a cluster of 30 raspberry pis and one of <a target="_blank" href="https://hprc.tamu.edu/">A&M's supercomputers</a>. Since then I have setup a personal raspberry pi cluster using 5 of the newer 4b, 4GB models. Computer architecture is another interesting subject I have been introduced to in my classes. Early in my sophomore year I learned about a hardware description language called Verilog. This language, among other things, describes what components exist in a digital system. Creating a compiler that would interpret these pieces and evaluate the different signals at specific times presented interesting questions, so I took on the challenge. I ended up with a working compiler which ran on code very similar to Verilog. This project helped me understand the intricacies of computer hardware and has made further study into computer archtecture easier. My final major interest is in cybersecurity. A&M has an excellent <a target="_blank" href="https://cybersecurity.tamu.edu/students-corner/extracurricular-activities/texas-am-cybersecurity-club/">cybersecurity club</a>, and I have attended several of their meetings. In addition, I have a cybersecurity internship with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sandia.gov/">Sandia National Labs</a> in the Summer of 2020 where I will learn much more about the field.</p>
		<p style="text-align:left;">My grandfather, a statistician in the military, first taught me about coding when I was 10 years old. I worked with the simple language he used, called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.terrapinlogo.com/">Terrapin Logo</a>, for several years. I loved trying to make games with this language, and those experiences taught me about many elementary programming constructs. When I got to middle school, I tired of the slowness and simplicity of Logo. I had just heard of Minecraft, which was programmed in Java, so I decided Java would be my next tool. I spent hours and hours programming games, learning the intricacies of Java, and developing talents I would later use in college. Once I got to college, I branched out into many other languages -- C#, Python, HTML, and especially C++. These last couple years, I have continued making projects and building my skills. I have developed interests in several areas and intend to continue to explore them as I have time.</p>
